# API-Homework
In the attached notebook I have created a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.
I have also created a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. The retirment planning tool can also be adjusted to plan for an early retirment. The Monte Carlo simulations help us determine what a financially healthy returment could look like.
